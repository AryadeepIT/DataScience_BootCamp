# Given three integer, a,d and n. Where a is the first term, d is the common difference of an A.P.  Calculate the nth term of A.P.  The nth term is given by an = a + (n-1)d

a = int(input())
d = int(input())
n = int(input())

# Complete the code below
ans = a + (n-1)*d
# Complete the code above

# The line below prints the output. Don't change it!
print(ans)
