# Given four inputs that are stored in variables a,b,c, and d. You need to write an expression to evaluate the following formula. Use integer division. The expression should be a single statement. (a+b/c)+d

a = int(input())
b = int(input())
c = int(input())
d = int(input())

# Complete the code below that stores the output of the expression
res = ((a+b)//c) + d
# Complete the code above that stores the output of the expression

# This prints the output. Don't change it!
print(res)
